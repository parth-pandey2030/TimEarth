# TimEarth
A React.js application (for my 6th grade science project) that shows a timeline of climate change. The name is pronounced "Time-Earth".

# What it is
TimEarth is a web app that displays details of climate change and how to prevent it (or rather, help prevent it). It shows a graph of greenhouse gas emissions from now until 2100, data on when top emitters plan to become net zero, and a page on what you (and others like you) can do to help.

# Instructions for use
Here is a simple 3-step set of instructions for how to use the app:

1. Install Node.js (if you do not have it already):
To make sure you have Node.js, enter the following command in the command line:
```
node --version
```
If the command returns something (e.g., "v22.16.0") then you have Node.js. Else, please download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or go to a [Github Repo](https://bug-free-eureka-wr7w757p5w4wcvj7.github.dev/) (allows for ues of Node.js and NPM without having to download anything).

2. Download this repo:
Go to the [home page for this repository](https://github.com/parth-pandey2030/TimEarth). Then click "Code" and then "Download ZIP". Finally, extract the ZIP file you have just downloaded. You should now have a folder named "TimEarth-main".

3. Run the app:
In the command line, please navigate to the "TimEarth-main" folder and run the following set of commands (you can simply copy & paste):

```
cd timearth
npm start
```
