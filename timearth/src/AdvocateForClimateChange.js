    <p>
        It's not like countries aren't working against climate change. The biggest emitters actually 
        have plans to become net-zero. But it also isn't like they are working hard enough. India, the
        third biggest emitter, wants to become net-zero in 45 YEARS! So one way people can help is we can send
        letters, start petitions, to make countries stop worrying about problems like trade wars and actually
        spend the almost endless resources they have to stop the real, existential threat of climate change.
